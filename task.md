You have 1000 swaps per second coming from a producer (who, token, amount, usd, side,..). Producer also persists this data in db . Need to build a system that calculates real-time token statistics (5min volume, 1H volume, .. , 24h volume, transaction counts, etc) and serves this data via HTTP API and WebSocket updates with minimal latency. System must be highly available and handle restarts without losing data or missing events during startup time. It should be scalable, so we can spin more instances. Swaps data may contain duplicates and block order is not guaranteed. Theoretical. Design the complete architecture. What transport mechanisms would you use from producer? Where would you store different types of data? How would you ensure high availability and zero data loss? Practical. Implement the Go service that reads swap events from a channel, calculates statistics, serves the data over HTTP,Â  submits updates to a WebSocket channel and handles restarts. Use interfaces for storage.
